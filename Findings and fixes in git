1. Fix : Push issue
Create two repositories, one is named remote and another named local,
Clone remote in local and after adding few files in local, and trying to issue git push, at times it may encountered an error, 
and to fix that issue, execute below command in my remote directory

$ git config --local receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead

2. Fix : Checkout(Ambiguity to switch or to reset file)
Assuming we have two branches master and test
And if we are in test branch, 
Issue below command to switch to master

$ git checkout master 

If in my test branch there is file named master, also Iâ€™m in test branch then git checkout master will switch to master branch,
whereas to get revert modifications done in master file we should enter 

$ git checkout -- master
