1. Fix : Push issue
-------------------
Create two repositories, one is named remote and another named local,
Clone remote in local and after adding few files in local, and trying to issue git push, at times it may encountered an error, 
and to fix that issue, execute below command in my remote directory

$ git config --local receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead

2. Fix : Checkout(Ambiguity to switch or to reset file)
-------------------------------------------------------
Assuming we have two branches master and feature
And if we are in feature branch, to switch to master, we use below command

$ git checkout master 

Again assume we are in master branch and there is file named feature inside it,then git checkout feature will switch to feature branch,
whereas to reset changes done in feature file we should enter

$ git checkout -- feature
